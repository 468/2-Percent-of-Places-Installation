# 2-Percent-of-Places-Installation
Code for my 'Work in Progress' show piece at the Royal College of Art, '2% Of Spaces You Could Possibly Encounter'.

To function, requires the MAX-Scene-Classifier to be running locally on the main (ie, webcam connected) computer: https://github.com/IBM/MAX-Scene-Classifier/blob/master/README.md.

Code for controlling the Raspberry Pi-powered LED Sign (LDP-8008) uses https://github.com/nhfruchter/python-ldp8008; on this side, I have simply added code for connecting with (and receiving text input from) the main computer over bluetooth.
